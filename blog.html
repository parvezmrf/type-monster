                <span style="font-size:30px;">Local Storage</span> <br>
                Local storage saves data in the browser for long time untill clear storage or reset browser.
                localStorage data does not expire. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they
                are for objects.
                The data stored in LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over
                HTTP, localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS.

                <br><br>

                Local storage has 4 methods:
                <br><br>

                (1).setItem() Method - localStorage.setItem(key)
                <br>

                (2). getItem() Method - localStorage.getItem(key)
                <br>
                (3). removeItem() Method -localStorage.removeItem(key) <br>
                (4). clear() Method - localStorage.clear()
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                <span style="font-size:30px;">Session Storage</span> <br>
                Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                <br><br>
                A page's protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts
                accessed through HTTP is stored in a separate object from the same site
                accessed through HTTPS
                <br><br>

                Session storage has 4 methods:
                <br><br>

                (1).setItem() Method - sessionStorage.setItem(key)
                <br>

                (2). getItem() Method - sessionStorage.getItem(key)
                <br>
                (3). removeItem() Method -sessionStorage.removeItem(key) <br>
                (4). clear() Method - sessionStorage.clear()
                <br>

                <span style="font-size:30px;">Global Scope</span> <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.
                <br><br>
                <span style="font-size:30px;">Block Scope </span> <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.<br><br>

        <button class="accordion">What is an event loop in JavaScript?</button>
        <div class="panel-ans">
            <p id="question-ans">The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes
                all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                multi-threading.

                <br><br>
                The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a
                function is finished, it is popped from the stack.<br>

                The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                execution.<br>
                <br>

                Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate
                threads.
                <br>
                The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If
                it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call
                is processed.

                3. parameter that is not passed will be undefined.<br>
                4. if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.<br>
                5. property that does't exist in the object will show undefined.<br>
                5. index that does't exist in an object will show undefined.<br>

                7. deleting an element inside an array.<br>
                8. set a value directly to undefined.<br>
