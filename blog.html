        <button class="accordion"> Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage</button>
        <div class="panel-ans">
            <p id="question-ans">
                <span style="font-size:30px;">Local Storage</span> <br>
                This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored
                data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets
                cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last
                “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or
                incognito session).
                <br>
                <br>

                DOMStrings are storage formats that use UTF-16 to encode data, which uses two bytes per character.
                Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for objects. The data stored in
                LocalStorage is specific to a protocol in the document. If the site is loaded over HTTP (e.g.,
                http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than if it is loaded over HTTPS (e.g.,
                https://abc.com). <br>
                <br>


                If a document is loaded from a file: URL (that is, directly from the user’s local file system instead of
                being loaded from the server) the requirements for behavior are undefined and may vary among different
                browsers. Each file appears to be returned a different object by localStorage in all current browsers:
                URL. Essentially, it seems to be a case of each URL: file having its own unique local storage area.
                <br>
                <br>
                This behavior cannot be guaranteed because as mentioned above, the file: URL requirements remain
                unclear. As such, there’s a possibility that browsers may change how they handle files at any time. The
                way some browsers handle it has evolved.
                <br><br>

                Local storage has 4 methods:
                <br><br>

                (1).setItem() Method - localStorage.setItem(key)
                <br>

                (2). getItem() Method - localStorage.getItem(key)
                <br>
                (3). removeItem() Method -localStorage.removeItem(key) <br>
                (4). clear() Method - localStorage.clear()
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="font-size:30px;">Session Storage</span> <br>
                Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The difference
                between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas
                sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.
                <br><br>
                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid
                for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is
                open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab
                or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the
                same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original
                tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
                objects.
                <br><br>
                A page’s protocol determines what data is stored in sessionStorage. Particularly, data stored by scripts
                accessed through HTTP (for example, http://abc.com) is stored in a separate object from the same site
                accessed through HTTPS (for instance, https://abc.com). A DOMString number is two bytes per character in
                UTF-16 DOMString format. Strings are automatically generated from integer keys just as they are for
                objects.
                <br><br>

                Session storage has 4 methods:
                <br><br>

                (1).setItem() Method - sessionStorage.setItem(key)
                <br>

                (2). getItem() Method - sessionStorage.getItem(key)
                <br>
                (3). removeItem() Method -sessionStorage.removeItem(key) <br>
                (4). clear() Method - sessionStorage.clear()
                <br>

        <button class="accordion">JavaScript Global and Block Scope | Explained</button>
        <div class="panel-ans">
            <p id="question-ans">
                <span style="font-size:30px;">Global Scope</span> <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
                global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                function or conditional state can access that variable.
                <br>
                For example
                <br><br>
                <code> var name = "linuxHint";
                    <br>
                function printName(){ <br>
                // the variable can be accessed inside here<br>
                console.log("This tutorial is by "+name);<br>
                }
                <br>
                printName();
            </code><br> <br><br>

                <span style="font-size:30px;">Block Scope </span> <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
                statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly
                brackets {}.<br><br>

                Imagine a nested situation:<br>
                A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables.<br><br>
                <code>
                {<br>
                 let a = 10;<br>
                const b = 5;<br>
                }<br>
                This block of code is itself inside a function.<br>
                <br>
                function addition() {<br>
                {<br>
                let a = 10;<br>
                const b = 5;<br>
                }<br>
                }<br>
               
            </code>
            </p>
